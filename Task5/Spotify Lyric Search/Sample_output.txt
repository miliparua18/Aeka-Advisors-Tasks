She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine   Who could ever believe that she could be mine?   She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue   And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?      And when we go for a walk in the park   And she holds me and squeezes my hand   We'll go on walking for hours and talking   About all the things that we plan      She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine   Who could ever believe that she could be mine?   She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue   And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?  "
